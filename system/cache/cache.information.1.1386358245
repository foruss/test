When the vehicle arrives to the port the title/ownership and accompanying documents are submitted to U.S. Customs. Please note, NJ customs are overburdened due to very high volume, and delays are not uncommon. The vehicle will be loaded onto the next vessel with available cargo space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This can cause significant delays for the shipping process as the vehicle will not be picked up until the title/ownership is present. Please ask an Automix representative if the vehicle title/ownership is present prior to purchase to avoid this delay.&lt;/td&gt;

States with low traffic volume include, but are not limited to, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Delays can also occur due to bad weather conditions in the winter months. Please note that other potential delays can occur from truck breakdowns which are rare but unavoidable.&lt;/td&gt;

This limits the amount of empty trucks moving South along the Eastern shore of the U.S.A. To ports in Georgia and Florida causing the potential delays for vehicle delivery to ports and warehouses. This trend is reversed in the pre-summer months.&lt;/td&gt;

			Please note, NJ customs are overburdened due to very high volume, and delays with documentation are not uncommon. When shipping RORO there may be delays due to the large volume the shipping line is experiencing, in this case, the vehicle will be loaded onto the next vessel with available cargo space.&lt;/p&gt;

Some dealerships that list vehicles for sale on our website use third-party service providers to manage their &quot;leads&quot; (that is, the inquiries they receive from consumers who are interested in the vehicles they've listed for sale). If a dealership has designated a provider of lead management services, we may also share with that provider any information you elect to send to the dealership through our &quot;Email to Frend&quot; form.

GENERAL INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The TOS and the relationship between you and Automix&amp;nbsp;shall be governed by the laws of the State of&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Florida without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Automix&amp;nbsp;agree to submit to the personal&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Pinellas, in the state of Florida. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
failure of Automix&amp;nbsp;to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties'&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Automixs.com is also&amp;nbsp;vehicle listing and information service that brings together buyers and sellers. Automixs.com / Automix Inc is not a party to any transaction between vehicle buyers and sellers that originates on or through this website. Information about a particular vehicle is supplied by the seller, not by Automixs.com. The price and other terms of any sale remain subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Though we hope that all who come to Automixs.com will act honorably and treat each other fairly, we cannot verify the information that sellers supply or guarantee the vehicles they offer. Nor can we assure the seller of a vehicle that the payment he or she receives from the buyer is legitimate. When using this website to find a buyer for your vehicle or a vehicle to purchase, we urge you to use the same common sense and good judgment you would use in selling a vehicle through, or responding to, a classified ad in the newspaper.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Please read our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;fraud awareness tips&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;before you buy or list a vehicle on our website. There is no substitute for healthy skepticism and your own good judgment.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;The prices listed by sellers on Automixs.com often exclude sales tax, finance charges, title, license, regulatory, dealer documentary, emission testing, and compliance fees, any or all of which may be added to the listed price to arrive at the final sale price of a particular vehicle. Before purchasing a vehicle or any other good or service you have read about on Automixs.com, you should confirm with the seller any information, including the price, that is important to your purchasing decision. Automixs.com is not responsible for, and does not guarantee the performance of, any such vehicles, goods or services listed or researched on Automixs.com.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;We may screen some email messages sent through our website to sellers about vehicles listed on Automixs.com. If it appears that your email message has not reached the seller of the vehicle you are inquiring about, you might try inquiring by telephone if the seller has provided a telephone number.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Our used car listings include vehicles that have been &quot;certified&quot; as meeting certain standards established by manufacturers and/or dealers in connection with their pre-owned vehicle programs. The decision to certify any particular vehicle is made by the certifying manufacturer or dealer, and the vehicle information included in Automixs.com's certified vehicle listing is provided by the listing dealer. Neither Automixs.com nor the manufacturer is responsible for the accuracy of any information contained in a certified vehicle listing. Only the party that certifies a vehicle is responsible for the decision to certify that vehicle. You should familiarize yourself with the terms of the applicable certification program before buying a certified vehicle. Ads purchased by private sellers through our Sell Your Car service will not appear in any &quot;certified&quot; area of our website. Ads for certified vehicles apply only to vehicles certified by dealers in accordance with the certification programs of the automobile manufacturers with which we have partnerships.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Automixs.com offers a variety of ad packages to private sellers, with combinations of features that may vary by market area. For information about the ad packages available to private sellers in your area, click the &quot;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Your Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&quot; tab or button on our home page.

			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;In order for you to offer a vehicle for sale through our Sell Your Car service for private sellers, you must agree to our Terms of Sale. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Terms of Sale&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;require, among other things, that you be prepared to sell your vehicle at the price at which, and on the terms on which, you have listed it. You must have possession of the actual vehicle listed and the ability to transfer title. To list a vehicle for sale on Automixs.com, sellers also are required to provide certain identifying and contact information. The information must accurately identify the seller and the method of contact must permit buyers to communicate directly with the seller. You may not charge any potential buyer for information about any vehicle listed for sale on Automixs.com, nor may you use our website to promote, without our prior written permission, any other website, product, or service.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;By using our website to sell your vehicle as a private seller, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age, that you are not a motor vehicle dealer, that you are not listing a vehicle for sale in your capacity as an owner, employee or representative of a dealer, and that neither you nor anyone acting on your behalf will list more than five vehicles for sale simultaneously. A private seller who wishes to list more than five vehicles simultaneously, and any commercial dealer wishing to list any vehicle, must make arrangements with us before doing so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;When you list a vehicle for sale through our Sell Your Car service, we may obtain additional distribution for your listing through our relationships with other websites, including KBB.com, Univision, MSN Autos, MSN Latino, and NADA Guides. We also may promote your listing on or through third-party websites or services. Neither Automixs.com nor any website through which we distribute or promote your listing will charge you any additional fee for this additional exposure. It is simply added value from Automixs.com. Our promotional partners will not contact you with offers to sell you additional distribution or add-on advertising services for your listing without your permission. If third parties contact you without your permission offering to sell you such services, they have likely misused the Automixs.com website and violated this Visitor Agreement to exploit your listing information. If you receive any such solicitations that you did not authorize, please bring them to our attention by using our &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contact us form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Listings are not to be used to advertise more than one vehicle, regardless of a listing's duration. For this reason, you cannot edit your vehicle's year, make, model, or VIN once you have purchased a listing. Always double-check this information before purchasing a listing. Listing fees are generally not refundable, so if you enter incorrect information in the year, make, model, or VIN fields, you will have to delete the listing and purchase a new one to create an accurate listing. By using Automixs.com to sell your vehicle, you agree to pay the price of the package you select and the prices of any advertising upgrades, regardless of whether your vehicle sells as a result of the listing. You also agree to pay any applicable taxes relating to your use of the Sell Your Car service. Click here for our &lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refund Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;Responsibility for the information contained in each listing lies with each seller. You alone are responsible for the material you post, including listing information and photos of your vehicle, and for the content of all email messages you transmit through Automixs.com. Nothing will undermine a user's confidence in the vehicle you are looking to sell faster than inaccurate statements or misleading representations about the vehicle. And since any erosion of user confidence in you is likely to be accompanied by erosion of user confidence in us, we care deeply about making sure that the information you supply is accurate and that, in all respects, you treat other Automixs.com users fairly and honorably.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;In connection with our efforts to combat Internet fraud, some listings may be screened before being posted publicly. This process may delay the publication of your listing. Though we cannot monitor every transaction that originates through a listing on Automixs.com, we may, from time to time, perform random quality assurance tests to confirm that those who offer vehicles for sale over Automixs.com are prepared to sell those vehicles at the prices and on the terms which such vehicles are advertised. By using our website, you agree to cooperate in these quality assurance tests. If our tests reveal, or we otherwise learn, that a seller may be violating the terms of this Visitor Agreement, we reserve the right to deny that seller use of services offered on our website and any affiliated websites and remove that seller's listings from each site.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;By listing a vehicle for sale on this website, you agree to use the email addresses of those responding to your listing only to communicate with them about the potential sale of that vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
